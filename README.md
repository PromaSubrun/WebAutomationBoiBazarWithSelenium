# WebAutomationBoiBazarWithSelenium

This GitHub repository contains a Java project for web automation using Selenium, a popular framework for browser automation. The project focuses on automating tasks related to BoiBazar, and this README provides a brief overview of the project and how to get started.

Getting Started:

1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/PromaSubrun/WebAutomationBoiBazarWithSelenium.git
2. Import the Project: Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Set Up Dependencies: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies, including Selenium WebDriver, configured in your project.
4. Write Your Automation Script: In the project, you will find Java classes where you can write your automation scripts for BoiBazar.
5. Run Your Script: Execute your automation script to perform tasks on the BoiBazar website.

Project Structure:

.settings: This directory may contain project-specific settings for your IDE (e.g., Eclipse settings).

src: This is the directory where your Java source code files are located. You write your code in this directory.

target: This directory usually contains compiled bytecode and other generated files. Maven typically places build artifacts here.

test-output: This directory may contain output and reports generated by testing frameworks (e.g., TestNG reports).

.classpath: This file specifies the classpath for your project. It's used by your IDE to locate classes and resources.

.gitattributes: This file defines attributes for Git repositories, specifying how files should be treated.

.project: This file is an Eclipse-specific configuration file that defines project settings.

README.md: This is a Markdown file that typically contains project documentation and instructions (like the READMEs I helped you create earlier).

chromedriver.exe: This is an executable file for the Chrome WebDriver, which is used for automating web interactions in Selenium with the Chrome browser.

pom.xml: This is the Project Object Model (POM) file for Maven projects. It defines project dependencies, build settings, and other project-related configurations.

testng.xml: This XML file is used with the TestNG testing framework to configure and run your test suites.

Writing Automation Scripts:

You can create and customize automation scripts within the src directory. Leverage Selenium WebDriver capabilities to interact with web elements, navigate pages, and perform actions on the BoiBazar website.

Contributing:

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve this automation project.

Happy Automating! ðŸš€
